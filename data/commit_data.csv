Goal: passing of connection properties (the 'info') from the remote

Changes include:
 * in Meta: explicit opening of connections: there is a new
   openConnection() call. Client decides on the connection id.
   Implicit creation of unknown connections is gone.
 * JdbcMeta: default connection is gone, all methods have been
   extended with a connection id.
 * correspondingly, the various Service.Request's now carry a
   connection id (will make fixing CALCITE-871 easy)
 * (unrelated, but was useful for testing) more meaningful error

Some of those do break compatibility (Expression vs Script in particular, NaN as literal, logging is log4j); since 3.0 has never been released and the code has not been modified in the past 14 months, no-one should argue  (or then should contribute :-)).

From the changes.xml:
Fixed issue in edge case method resolution wrt overload and varargs;
Switch logging to log4j 1.2;
Empty array property setting fails Fixes JEXL-144. Thanks to Woonsang Ko.	;
Map expression issue with empty key Fixes JEXL-142. Thanks to Juozas Baliuks.;
Suffix for Big Decimal and Big Integer Literal is incorrectly mentioned in Java docs Fixes JEXL-141. Thanks to Harpreet Singh.;
Invalid script variable list for nested array/map access Fixes JEXL-137;
Fixed Engine.getVariables that was erroneously considering method calls as variable usage;
Fixed issue in ternary expression (grammar was not precise enough to differentiate namespace:function calls vs ternary right hand side);
NaN is now a keyword equivalent to #NaN (deprecated): POTENTIAL SCRIPT BREAK;
Syntactically enforce that expressions do not contain statements: POTENTIAL EXPRESSION BREAK (ie an expression is not a script and can NOT use 'if','for'... and blocks);
Added syntactic shortcut to create parametric scripts (script source creates an anonymous function);
Segregated JexlScript and JexlExpression further to avoid calling JexlExpression.evaluate on JexlScript (instead of JexlScript.execute) which had the unexpected property of only evaluating the first statement;
Fix an edge case of ambiguous method matching (see http://apache-commons.680414.n4.nabble.com/jexl-mathod-within-namespace-not-found-if-parameter-is-int-tt4637888.html);
Fix issue wrt isEmpty and method varargs (assignable types vs equal types) (see http://apache-commons.680414.n4.nabble.com/jexl-empty-function-crashes-if-called-with-int-tt4637895.html)

Now users can select their own page signature implementation, possibly
with better properties than the old one.

Two implementations are provided:

* MD5Signature: backward-compatible with the old schema.

* TextProfileSignature: an example implementation of a signature, which
  gives the same values for near-duplicate pages. Please see Javadoc for
  more information.

This commit changes the CrawlDatum to store page signatures in CrawlDb.
Last modified time field was added, too. Both changes are in preparation
for patches implementing self-adjustable fetch interval.

NutchConf was extended to store and retrieve also plain Object values.
This is useful when caching per-job instances.

StringUtil: added methods to display / parse byte[] values.

Added SegmentReader (based on a contribution in NUTCH-121 by Rod Taylor).

Description:

Simplify how synthetics are used in preparation for implementing
Ihab's custom node idea for pluggable code generators.


Goal
====
Ihab pointed out that the current synthetic mechanism combined with
pipelining makes it impossible to make the TCB smaller than all
possible code that a pipeline author could write.

There are a couple existing pipeline stages that generate synthetic
content -- GXP templates for HTML, CSS templates, the HtmlCompiler
code that extracts HTML event handlers.

The goal of this CL is to lay the groundwork for a narrow definition
of synthetic, so that we can have both an extensible pipeline and a
small TCB.


Design
======
Create a few custom nodes with rigorous consistency checks that are
passed through by the DefaultCajaRewriter.

The custom nodes will be part of the TCB, and any user code they
contain must be exposed as children.  At render time, the custom nodes
construct a parse tree of regular node, and delegate rendering to
that.


Material Changes in this CL
===========================
Previously, any node could be marked synthetic.  Now only
FunctionConstructors and Identifiers can.  Since SyntheticNodes.java
now knows about JS node types, I moved it into ...parser.js from
...parser.

Previously there was one rewriter rule that did an expandAll on any
synthetic node.  Now there is one per specific construct that we want
to pass through.

Changed QuasiBuilder so that when it parses a quasiliteral,
identifiers that end in __ are marked synthetic since they are clearly
intentional rules violations.

Added /*@synthetic*/ syntax to specify that the next synthesizable node
in a quasiliteral should be synthetic when produced in subst.


Other Changes in this CL
========================
Got rid of all the semicolon insertion warnings from
DefaultCajaRewriterTest's logs.

Fixed bug:  parser was expecting a semicolon after with-statements.


Open Questions
==============
Why do we need to ignore synthetic functions in determining in which
scope temporaries are declared?


Still TODO
==========
Define custom nodes for html event handlers and other code generators,
and get rid of the rules for Identifier and FunctionConstructor.

229,30ba0d1,"['Testing', 'Maintenance']","faster ParseTreeNode visitor
http://codereview.appspot.com/6305076

ParseTreeNode has tree-walk methods called acceptPreOrder and
acceptPostOrder that are worst-case O(n) space and O(n**2) time.

The O(n) space is because ParseTreeNode does not have a link
to the node's parent, but some visitors want to know a node's
parent, so the tree-walker constructs a new AncestorChain object
to hold a node and its parent, then gives that AncestorChain to
the visitor.  This is wasted effort when a visitor doesn't care
about a node's parent.

The O(n**2) time is because the tree-walker tries to be robust
against mutations to the tree that affect the current node's
place in the tree, so before (or after) visiting each node,
it checks whether the node is still a child of the parent,
which requires a linear search of the parent's children list.

So, previously I had replaced one instance of acceptPreOrder
with a faster visitPreOrder method.

This patch expands on that, makes visitPreOrder faster and
simpler, and also uses it in more places.

* Extract constants for org.objectweb.asm.Type objects wherever possible.  Internally, these are represented as a String and so Type.getType(Class) does a bunch of string manipulation.  Promoting to constants amortizes this.
* Make ClassData no-longer be an @AutoValue.  @AutoValue by default clone()s primitive arrays on access (!) and so by not being an @AutoValue we can avoid a bunch of accidental buffer copies.
* Introduce a generic debug flag and use it to guard a bunch of checks in the compiler.  All of the checks are generally redundant with bytecode verification.  So now they will only be enabled in tests.

To conform to the Set equality contract TransitionTarget must implement the equals and hashcode methods.
But in the context of SCXML and the purpose of the algorithm, really only identity based equality should be considered.
The TransitionTarget#id property also could be used, but that would make the API much more awkward to ensure only unique IDs are used, that is: within the context of a single SCXML instance.
Much easier therefore is to just enforce and only support identity based equality.

This adds `EncodingStats`, which tracks the number of pages for each encoding, separated into dictionary and data pages. It also adds convenience functions that are useful for dictionary filtering, like `hasDictionaryEncodedPages` and `hasNonDictionaryEncodedPages`.

`EncodingStats` have a unit test in parquet-column and an integration test in parquet-hadoop that writes a file and verifies the stats are present and correct when it is read.

remove noembed support
http://codereview.appspot.com/6737049

when I implemented <embed> support, I also implemented <noembed>
support, and now I kinda regret it, because there are hazards
around any rawtext element.  none of the modern/supported browsers
will have problems, but there are potential problems if someone
attempts html rewriting without awareness of the rawtext problems,
so I think it's safer to just disallow noembed.

I don't know of any real demand for noembed, so this shouldn't
be a problem for users.  Some cut+paste html snippets have both
embed and noembed forms; we'll delete the noembed and its contents,
which is the right thing to do.

so this CL blacklists noembed and removes support for it.

<unassigned>

In the renderUnsafe mode, we currently disallow comments that begin with or end
with '-' because of the Html 5 and XML 1 specs.

This causes an IllegalStateException with the message ""XML comment unrenderable
because it ends with '-'"" to be thrown when parsing some documents:

However, browsers do handle these gracefully and allow these extra hyphens, as
can be seen in the following discussions:
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.4
http://marcorogers.com/blog/08-02-2009/strange-firefox-rendering-bug

This patch modifies comments that begin or end with hyphens or contain
consecutive hyphens, to make them spec-compliant.

4. Made CharProducer a CharSequence so that it can fit better with

5. Fixed Scope around ""this"" and ""arguments""
6. Changed parse tree nodes for ""finally"", ""catch"", ""try"" blocks to
reflect the fact that they cannot be followed by a non-block
statement.
E.g. try foo(); catch (e) bar(); is syntactically invalid.
7. Added a renderBody method to function so that we can render
programs without an extra set of curly braces.
8. Removed unused imports from CompileHtmlStage and cleaned up
warnings in CajolingService
9. Moved optimization specific code from BuildServiceImplementation to
a new class JsOptimizer.
10. Changed RenderContext to allow better minified rendering of object
ctors.

the slow path test was already doing), in order to test that the own

promoting warnings to errors and errors to warnings.

This CL changes error-prone options handling to make it cleaner, allow users
to enable non-default checks, and allow users to override the built-in severity
level (warning vs. error).

Old-style error-prone flags looked like:
-Xepdisable:<checkName[,checkName...]

New error-prone flags look like:
-Xep:<checkName>[:severity]
where severity is one of {OFF, WARN, ERROR}.  If no severity is provided, then
the default severity is used.

This change retains support for the old-style flags until we can clean
the depot.

99% of this is adding missing @Override annotations, in the long tail we also have

* insert missing calls to Assert.fail() in tests that are testing exception behavior
* rewrite a few cases of Foo.class.instanceof(c) to c instanceof Foo
* rewrite Class.newInstance - > Class.getConstructor().newInstance() which doesn't break checked exception checking.
* adding @javax.inject.Inject annotations to methods that override methods annotated with @javax.inject.Inject

 - In the error message for UsingCorrespondence.contains(), say ""elements that"" instead of ""elements which"". It's a restrictive clause. (See e.g. http://www.getitwriteonline.com/archive/103103whichthat.htm for the grammar geekery.)
 - Clarify a couple of bits of javadoc which seems vague/confusing.
