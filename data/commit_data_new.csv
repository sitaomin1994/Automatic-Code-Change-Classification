To conform to the Set equality contract TransitionTarget must implement the equals and hashcode methods.
But in the context of SCXML and the purpose of the algorithm, really only identity based equality should be considered.
The TransitionTarget#id property also could be used, but that would make the API much more awkward to ensure only unique IDs are used, that is: within the context of a single SCXML instance.
Much easier therefore is to just enforce and only support identity based equality.

Binding a UNIX domain socket creates the socket file with the
current umask.  This may permit evil members of the caller's group
to connect to the socket before the listening process can mark it

Instead, create a temporary directory that is accessible only to
the owner, and only after the location is locked down, create the
socket within it as a unique random name.

This adds `EncodingStats`, which tracks the number of pages for each encoding, separated into dictionary and data pages. It also adds convenience functions that are useful for dictionary filtering, like `hasDictionaryEncodedPages` and `hasNonDictionaryEncodedPages`.

`EncodingStats` have a unit test in parquet-column and an integration test in parquet-hadoop that writes a file and verifies the stats are present and correct when it is read.

This includes commits from #330 because it updates the dictionary filter. I'll rebase and remove them once it is merged.

remove noembed support
http://codereview.appspot.com/6737049

when I implemented <embed> support, I also implemented <noembed>
support, and now I kinda regret it, because there are hazards
around any rawtext element.  none of the modern/supported browsers
will have problems, but there are potential problems if someone
attempts html rewriting without awareness of the rawtext problems,
so I think it's safer to just disallow noembed.

I don't know of any real demand for noembed, so this shouldn't
be a problem for users.  Some cut+paste html snippets have both
embed and noembed forms; we'll delete the noembed and its contents,
which is the right thing to do.

so this CL blacklists noembed and removes support for it.

<unassigned>

In the renderUnsafe mode, we currently disallow comments that begin with or end
with '-' because of the Html 5 and XML 1 specs.

This causes an IllegalStateException with the message ""XML comment unrenderable
because it ends with '-'"" to be thrown when parsing some documents:

However, browsers do handle these gracefully and allow these extra hyphens, as
can be seen in the following discussions:
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.4
http://marcorogers.com/blog/08-02-2009/strange-firefox-rendering-bug

This patch modifies comments that begin or end with hyphens or contain
consecutive hyphens, to make them spec-compliant.

Patch from Anupama. Thanks!

problematic tags like <option> and <td> which are ignored by
HTML5 rules unless they appear inside ceratin elements.
3. Upgraded to a moder version of servlet.jar to get rid of noisy
warnings from webdriver when running DomitaTest
4. Made CharProducer a CharSequence so that it can fit better with
the snippet producers.
5. Fixed Scope around ""this"" and ""arguments""
6. Changed parse tree nodes for ""finally"", ""catch"", ""try"" blocks to
reflect the fact that they cannot be followed by a non-block
statement.
E.g. try foo(); catch (e) bar(); is syntactically invalid.
7. Added a renderBody method to function so that we can render

8. Removed unused imports from CompileHtmlStage and cleaned up

9. Moved optimization specific code from BuildServiceImplementation to

One way to provide these snippets would be to call toSourceString() on each node. However, there is no guarantee that this is the actual human-composed source code. It would probably get confusing.

ErrorPrettyPrinter has exactly the snippet logic we need. This CL extracts it into a new class, SnippetFormatter, since snippets are useful for more than errors.

- Provide a mechanism to disable this pass for some cases. For example, GwtSoy does not support IJ data so it should not run this pass. Most of the tests that rely on AST structure should not run this pass as well.

promoting warnings to errors and errors to warnings.

This CL changes error-prone options handling to make it cleaner, allow users
to enable non-default checks, and allow users to override the built-in severity
level (warning vs. error).

Old-style error-prone flags looked like:
-Xepdisable:<checkName[,checkName...]

New error-prone flags look like:
-Xep:<checkName>[:severity]
where severity is one of {OFF, WARN, ERROR}.  If no severity is provided, then
the default severity is used.

This change retains support for the old-style flags until we can clean
the depot.

Technically this is a contract change, but in fact the implementations were already throwing IllegalArgumentException, so in practice anyone that was depending on that documentation being accurate (by, say, catching UnsupportedOperationException) was already in trouble, so IMO we should just make this change without trying to worry about backward compatibility; this is just a bug fix.

* insert missing calls to Assert.fail() in tests that are testing exception behavior
* rewrite a few cases of Foo.class.instanceof(c) to c instanceof Foo
* rewrite Class.newInstance - > Class.getConstructor().newInstance() which doesn't break checked exception checking.
* adding @javax.inject.Inject annotations to methods that override methods annotated with @javax.inject.Inject

Add model that demonstrates lattices.

Allow lattice 'sql' attribute to be multi-line in lattice, view and materialization.

Don't allow roll up distinct-count.

When generating SQL in JDBC adapter, translate $SUM0 as SUM.

Fix enumerator over single-column ArrayTable.

Document model for lattice, tile, measure.

Improve algorithm to look for tiles that match a query, to allow inexact matches.

Look for materialized tiles that can be rolled up before creating a tile that is an exact match for the query. If there is a tile that has the right dimensionality but the wrong measures, in the worst case create a new tile with the union of the measures. If there are multiple tiles that can be rolled up, choose the one with the fewest rows.

Add attribute ""algorithmMaxMillis"" to JSON lattice element, and improve documentation for JSON model.

Make class TileKey top-level.

Add AggregateCall.create, which can infer the type of the call before creating it. This allows us to make SqlSumEmptyIsZeroAggFunction a singleton, by removing its type argument.

Deprecate interface Aggregation; new code should use SqlAggFunction.

However, we cannot return an object of the passed in target class because
the methods' behavior is to return the passed in object if no suitable

Remove the tracker from the list first. Theres a potential loop-for-ever situation if for some reason the delete fails because the Tracker will have been removed from the queue but still be in the List - and this method loops until the List is empty.

Hopefully this will also resolve the FileCleaningTrackerTestCase's OutOfMemoryError in Gump and Continuum. Its failing during the file.delete() operation - the test code to fill-up-memory continues until the Tracker List is zero.

Synchronized return type length calculation logic between limit 0 and regular queries.

2. Deprecated width and changed it to precision for string types in MajorType.

3. Revisited FunctionScope and splitted it into FunctionScope and ReturnType.
FunctionScope will indicate only function usage in term of number of in / out rows, (n -> 1, 1 -> 1, 1->n).
New annotation in UDFs ReturnType will indicate which return type strategy should be used.

* Replaced the old HBase APIs (HBaseAdmin/HTable) with the new HBase 1.1 APIs (Connection/Admin/Table).
* Added HBaseConnectionManager class which which manages the life-cycle of HBase connections inside a Drillbit process.
* Updated HBase dependencies version to 1.1.3 and 1.1.1-mapr-1602-m7-5.1.0 for default and ""mapr"" profiles respectively.
* Added `commons-logging` dependency in the `provided` scope to allow HBase test cluster to come up for Unit tests.
* Relaxed banned dependency rule for `commons-logging` library for `storage-hbase` module alone, in provided scope only.
* Removed the use of many deprecated APIs throughout the modules code.
* Added some missing test to HBase storage plugin's test suit.
* Move the GuavaPatcher code to main code execution path.
* Log a message if GuavaPatcher fails instead of exiting.

Summary: This code adds the ability to adaptively control the out-of-core mechanism for graph data structure at run-time during input/output superstep and computation superstep. Basically, the implemented mechanism monitors the amount of available free memory in a separate thread. If there is not enough memory, the code adjusts the number of partitions in memory, and spills a series of partitions/buffers to disk. Also, if the amount of free memory is more than expected, some of the on-disk partitions are brought back to memory. Additionally, if amount of free memory is marginal, the mechanism mocks the memory usage by gradually bringing partitions to memory.

Test Plan:
mvn clean verify
Unit tests added to giraph-core
End-to-end test added to giraph-example
Running the code on PageRank on a large graph and not getting OOM failures.

Summary:
This diff proposes the following:
  - The persistence layer is decoupled from out-of-core infrastructure. This way one can simply implement different data accessors for various persistence resources. The persistence layer for reading/writing from/to local file system is implemented in this diff.
  - Previously, out-of-core data were indexed by string literals. This has changed for more flexibility. Now, data are accessible by a more flexible data indexing mechanism, in which a chain of indices are used to address a particular data.
  - With different implementations of data accessor, now there may be more emphasis on having more IO threads. It is important that these IO threads are load-balanced. In this diff, the mechanism to assign partitions to IO threads has changed.
  - All the coolness of Kryo's (de)serialization and RandomAccessFile (in D59277) is included in this diff, all at one place.

Test Plan:
mvn clean verify
out-of-core snapshot test passes

This reduces the usefulness of the user defined predicate, and meaningful predicates cannot be created. We can add a generic Object value that is passed through the api, which can internally be used in the keep function of the user defined predicate for creating many different types of filters.
For example, in spark sql, we can pass in a list of filter values for a where IN clause query and filter the row values based on that list.

Rewrite pretty printing to avoid long lines & horrible indentation.

Split out the bits of JavaScript rendering code relating to deciding
whether spaces or newlines are required/allowed between tokens.

Ihab pointed out that the side-by-side renderer is splitting lines in
ways that allow for semicolons to be inserted after return and throw.

This consolidates the code related to that.  In another CL I will
rewrite existing renderers to use this consistently, and in a third, I
will rewrite JsPrettyPrinter to do better formatting.  This CL is
simple and semantics preserving.  The second will be a more
substantial change but semantics preserving.  The third will not be
semantics preserving.

http://codereview.appspot.com/1541041

This fixes the remainder of issue 1103:

Felix said:
  the part that isn't fixed is that when a gadget has
    <body class=""foo"">...</body>
  the class attribute is removed, rather than reparented.

  the workaround in many cases is pretty simple:
  instead of putting a class on body, put the class on
  a div within the body.

  that doesn't work for yui because some widgets will
  insert nodes in body, which in caja will be a fake
  body that won't have the right classes, so the
  inserted nodes will not have the right style rules
  applied.

This addresses that.
(1) add to html-emitter.js a method that adds classes
    to the body.
(2) changes RewriteHtmlStage to find call the new
    HtmlEmitter method.
(3) changes CssRuleRewriter so that all CSS rules that
    involve body classes refer to the virtual body
(4) adds tests to domita_test.html to test body classes.

To make it easier to reuse the HTML attribute sanitizer, I moved
all the code in TemplateCompiler that dealt with attribute values
into a separate class: HtmlAttributeRewriter.

I created HtmlAttributeRewriter by doing (svn cp ...) so you should
be able to see the diffs between the two files which should be more
instructive than reading HtmlAttributeRewriter line by line.

I also reorganized the code that generates expressions from strings
and dynamic bits, since that's critical to generating code from
templates.  See JsConcatenator.

Also simplified CssRewriter -- it requires a PluginEnvironment but
nothing else from PluginMeta.

- Modified the Cajoling ANT task to allow <cajole valija=""true"">
- Added a BUILD rule to cajole domita_test.js with valija on
- Modified domita_test.html to run with valija when the URL parameter ?valija
  is present.
- Modified domita.js to allow event listeners to be added properly, and to 
- Cleaned up valija init code in DefaultValijaRewriterTest
- Removed zero arg constructor from ModuleEnvelope which violates invariant.
- Fixed a bug in caja.js that cause string.replace to fail under Valija.
- Fixed jsdoc build and squashed IDE and javadoc warnings.

Added a static factory Operation.undefined() which yields (void 0).

Modified ReturnStmt to allow for no return expression instead of

Modified Parser to produce ReturnStmt without return values, and to
use Operation.undefined() instead of UndefinedLiteral in
ArrayConstructors with adjacent commas.

Modified Parser to return Reference:undefined when the word

Because of the Turkish 'i', String#toLowerCase etc are unsafe to use.
We have Strings.toLowerCase etc that are safe, but they aren't used
universally.

This patch does:

- rename Strings.toLowerCase etc to Strings.lower etc, so that it's
easier to use a simple grep to find stray uses of the unsafe methods.

- add a shell script tools/codecheck.sh that complains if the unsafe
methods get used.  ""ant runtests"" will run codecheck.

- fix all uses of the unsafe methods.

- replace hand-coded loops in Strings.lower etc with standard calls
using Locale.ENGLISH, because it's less code to worry about.  This
behaves differently for non-ASCII characters, but we don't care as
long as it's consistent and isn't confused by Turkish 'i' issues.

Improves j2clOptBundlePass perf by running on just changed scopes.

In [] j2clOptBundlePass accounts for 7.15% of execution time. 4.0% of that time is the PureFunctionIdentifier and the other 3.15% is J2CL pass visitors.

Though this CL does not migrate *all* J2CL pass visitors to the new scope limited traversal, it does migrate most (and documents what is necessary to migrate the rest) and reduces that 3.15% cost to 1.5%.

This change implements automatic line index and character index
updates during write to the output buffer; it also includes a refactor
work on the code related with buffer.

Inspired by @flan's advice and taking some second thought, I extract
buffer related operations out into a independent class {@code
CodeBuffer} with public APIs. They could be optionally injected into
{@code CodePrinter} where they are used.  Core CodeBuffer APIs are
marked as final to ensure the correct behavior for {@code lineIndex}
and {@code charIndex} and prevent accidental override.

The detailed behaviors for public APIs are documented by {@code
CodeBufferTest}.

Special printer which needs buffer helpers could subclass CodeBuffer
and override some of the APIs. (Example at {@link
TemplateCompactPrinter} and inject into the printer class.)

At last, there are some cleanup work on related visitors to use the
safe APIs when writing out to buffer. For example, the deleteCharAt()
is replaced by deleteLastChar(). Also append(String) is replaced with
append(char) whenever possible.

The soy type system has a number of places where it gets out of touch with
reality and/or implements slightly looser semantics.  This have been the cause
of much pain.  So instead we limit the number of places that we reference it
and instead rely on our own understanding of the operators.

With this cl we (pretty much) only use the type system for params, data
accesses and literals.  There is probably more to remove but this is the bulk
of it.

This is supportable, but i don't forsee any usecases that wouldn't be better
supported by modifying the logging function implementation and supporting this
would complicate implementations.

NOTE: there actually still will be print directives by the time we get to code
generation since the contextual autoescaper works by inserting such directives.
But once we have this we can place some fairly strong guarantees on what the
autoescaper will do (single argumentless printdirective).

jbcsrc/internal:
contains code gen utilities that shouldn't be made available to plugin authors.

After this, the jbcsrc package is more focused on just turning the soy ast into bytecode instead of also definiing all the utilities for doing this.

Most of this was simply moving code and raising visibility from package private

* MutableGraph.java: mutation methods for Graph (extends Graph)

Graph<N, E> becomes Graph<N>.

Consequential changes:
* adding various new Network-specific classes (NetworkBuilder, AbstractNetwork, etc.)
* adapted Graph-specific classes to remove edge-related code

Note: Graph does not currently support parallel edges.

Motivations:
* Make graphs without explicit, first-class edge objects available.
* Remove mutation methods from the top-level interfaces so that Graph/Network objects supplied as their parameters don't (contractually) support modifications.  (And so that the slightly differing signatures for Graph and Network mutation methods don't cause user confusion.)

To do this i created a new BindingImpl + InternalFactory implementation for @Provides methods.  This was mostly modeled off of how ConstructorBindingImpl + ConstructorBindingImpl.Factory work (with ProviderMethod taking the place of ConstructorInjector).  This has the benefit of removing a bunch of overhead when @Provides methods construct their dependencies.

Before this change there is a definite gap in performance between the @Inject and @Provides strategies.  After this change @Provides is actually faster than @Inject constructors.  I believe this is due to the fact that there is no MembersInjector involved and the circular proxy logic is slightly simpler (so i will definitely be looking at this next!).

The overall benefit is simply due to
1. eliminating the ProviderLookup wrappers
2. eliminating the new InternalContext + InjectorImpl.callInContext for each @Provides invocation

For future work i want to look into eliminating more of the object allocations.  Currently there are 31 for this benchmark.  The bare minimum is 5 (because that is how many objects are getting constructed).

This cl saved 22 stack frames (~4 per @Provides method)

Description in the bug describes this best:
TypeConverterBindingProcessor has two responsibilities: 1) prepare built-in type
converters for primitives, enums, classes, etc. and 2) process TypeConverter
bindings and register them with the containing injector.

The first responsibility only needs the injector reference, it doesn't need
access to the processor's Errors cache. However, the current implementation
runs in the context of the processor and creates a number of anonymous classes,
and they all contain an implicit reference (this$0) back to the processor. This
can lead to some Errors instances being kept alive longer than necessary by
these anonymous classes, but not a large number.

Changing the prepareBuiltInConverters implementation over to use static methods
that pass the injector as an argument fixes this problem by removing the
implicit reference to the processor, since the anonymous classes are now
created from a static context.

Patch by Stuart McCulloch.  Thanks Stuart!

was redundant and made it possible for the two to be out of sync.

types) were set to java.lang.annotation.Enum, which was masked because

Given the method signature `void f(java.lang.@A String x);`, `@A` is
unambiguously a type annotation. Currently this isn't handled correctly
because the bound model doesn't distinguish between `java.lang.@A
String` and `@A String`, so if `@A` can target parameters it gets added
to the parameter declaration.

To handle this better, the parser now collects all ambiguous annotations
into the declaration annotation list. In practice, the only case that
changes is method declaration annotations that occur after the formal
type parameter list, e.g. previously `@A` was classified as a type
annotation in `<T> @A void f();`.

Finally, during disambiguation annotations are now only moved from
declarations to types, and never from types to declarations.

Some of those do break compatibility (Expression vs Script in particular, NaN as literal, logging is log4j); since 3.0 has never been released and the code has not been modified in the past 14 months, no-one should argue  (or then should contribute :-)).

From the changes.xml:
Fixed issue in edge case method resolution wrt overload and varargs;
Switch logging to log4j 1.2;
Empty array property setting fails Fixes JEXL-144. Thanks to Woonsang Ko.	;
Map expression issue with empty key Fixes JEXL-142. Thanks to Juozas Baliuks.;
Suffix for Big Decimal and Big Integer Literal is incorrectly mentioned in Java docs Fixes JEXL-141. Thanks to Harpreet Singh.;
Invalid script variable list for nested array/map access Fixes JEXL-137;
Fixed Engine.getVariables that was erroneously considering method calls as variable usage;
Fixed issue in ternary expression (grammar was not precise enough to differentiate namespace:function calls vs ternary right hand side);
NaN is now a keyword equivalent to #NaN (deprecated): POTENTIAL SCRIPT BREAK;
Syntactically enforce that expressions do not contain statements: POTENTIAL EXPRESSION BREAK (ie an expression is not a script and can NOT use 'if','for'... and blocks);
Added syntactic shortcut to create parametric scripts (script source creates an anonymous function);
Segregated JexlScript and JexlExpression further to avoid calling JexlExpression.evaluate on JexlScript (instead of JexlScript.execute) which had the unexpected property of only evaluating the first statement;
Fix an edge case of ambiguous method matching (see http://apache-commons.680414.n4.nabble.com/jexl-mathod-within-namespace-not-found-if-parameter-is-int-tt4637888.html);
Fix issue wrt isEmpty and method varargs (assignable types vs equal types) (see http://apache-commons.680414.n4.nabble.com/jexl-empty-function-crashes-if-called-with-int-tt4637895.html)

MD5 hash of a raw page content is very often unsuitable, when many
near-duplicate pages are crawled.

Now users can select their own page signature implementation, possibly
with better properties than the old one.

Two implementations are provided:

* MD5Signature: backward-compatible with the old schema.

* TextProfileSignature: an example implementation of a signature, which
  gives the same values for near-duplicate pages. Please see Javadoc for
  more information.

This commit changes the CrawlDatum to store page signatures in CrawlDb.
Last modified time field was added, too. Both changes are in preparation
for patches implementing self-adjustable fetch interval.

NutchConf was extended to store and retrieve also plain Object values.
This is useful when caching per-job instances.

StringUtil: added methods to display / parse byte[] values.

Added SegmentReader (based on a contribution in NUTCH-121 by Rod Taylor).

Fixed Fetcher to actually use the command-line parameters.

Description:

Simplify how synthetics are used in preparation for implementing
Ihab's custom node idea for pluggable code generators.


Goal
====
Ihab pointed out that the current synthetic mechanism combined with
pipelining makes it impossible to make the TCB smaller than all
possible code that a pipeline author could write.

There are a couple existing pipeline stages that generate synthetic
content -- GXP templates for HTML, CSS templates, the HtmlCompiler
code that extracts HTML event handlers.

The goal of this CL is to lay the groundwork for a narrow definition
of synthetic, so that we can have both an extensible pipeline and a
small TCB.


Design
======
Create a few custom nodes with rigorous consistency checks that are
passed through by the DefaultCajaRewriter.

The custom nodes will be part of the TCB, and any user code they
contain must be exposed as children.  At render time, the custom nodes
construct a parse tree of regular node, and delegate rendering to
that.


Material Changes in this CL
===========================
Previously, any node could be marked synthetic.  Now only
FunctionConstructors and Identifiers can.  Since SyntheticNodes.java
now knows about JS node types, I moved it into ...parser.js from
...parser.

Previously there was one rewriter rule that did an expandAll on any
synthetic node.  Now there is one per specific construct that we want
to pass through.

Changed QuasiBuilder so that when it parses a quasiliteral,
identifiers that end in __ are marked synthetic since they are clearly
intentional rules violations.

Added /*@synthetic*/ syntax to specify that the next synthesizable node
in a quasiliteral should be synthetic when produced in subst.


Other Changes in this CL
========================
Got rid of all the semicolon insertion warnings from
DefaultCajaRewriterTest's logs.

Fixed bug:  parser was expecting a semicolon after with-statements.


Open Questions
==============
Why do we need to ignore synthetic functions in determining in which
scope temporaries are declared?


Still TODO
==========
Define custom nodes for html event handlers and other code generators,
and get rid of the rules for Identifier and FunctionConstructor.

http://codereview.appspot.com/6305076

ParseTreeNode has tree-walk methods called acceptPreOrder and
acceptPostOrder that are worst-case O(n) space and O(n**2) time.

The O(n) space is because ParseTreeNode does not have a link
to the node's parent, but some visitors want to know a node's
parent, so the tree-walker constructs a new AncestorChain object
to hold a node and its parent, then gives that AncestorChain to
the visitor.  This is wasted effort when a visitor doesn't care
about a node's parent.

The O(n**2) time is because the tree-walker tries to be robust
against mutations to the tree that affect the current node's
place in the tree, so before (or after) visiting each node,
it checks whether the node is still a child of the parent,
which requires a linear search of the parent's children list.

So, previously I had replaced one instance of acceptPreOrder
with a faster visitPreOrder method.

This patch expands on that, makes visitPreOrder faster and
simpler, and also uses it in more places.

* Make ClassData no-longer be an @AutoValue.  @AutoValue by default clone()s primitive arrays on access (!) and so by not being an @AutoValue we can avoid a bunch of accidental buffer copies.
* Introduce a generic debug flag and use it to guard a bunch of checks in the compiler.  All of the checks are generally redundant with bytecode verification.  So now they will only be enabled in tests.
